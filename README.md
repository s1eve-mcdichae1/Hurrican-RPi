# Hurrican-RPi
Hurrican - Turrican clone

A freeware jump and shoot game made by Poke53280 (Eiswuxe) and based on the Turrican series of run and gun platformers.

Pi 4 only.

Issues:
- No "pause" or "menu" button on the gamepad. Once you begin a game, you *cannot exit* without a keyboard to press [Esc].
- With gamepad control enabled, game text reads, for example "`press Joypad leftJoypad rightJoypad upJoypad down to crouch`" instead of just "`press Joypad down to crouch`." Issue not present with keyboard control.
- Tutorial level crashes with a segfault, in the same place every time (just after the destructible wall where it shows you the smartbomb.) If you skip the tutorial then the main game *seems* to work okay but I haven't got very far in at all so something may still happen once you get farther in than the first half of the first level.
